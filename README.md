# Ewiki
A wiki built with Elixir and Phoenix.

For years I've used the [UseModWiki](www.usemod.com) at work to keep all my notes. I've found the
wiki concept the easiest way to enter and retrieve information. I can organize my notes
hierarchically or I can easily search them. My only consideration is to use enough descriptive
keywords in my notes so I can easily find them in the future.

I've been able to keep UseMod running on a series of Windows desktops and laptops. I run it
locally using IIS and a Windows Perl distribution, although in my last install I had to modify
the source code to update some function name changes in the newer Perl distributions.

My only dislike is the markup language. Not that it is bad, but I use Markdown for everything
else and would prefer to use Markdown in my wiki.

So, here it is, a clone of UseMod that uses Markdown.
